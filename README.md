# udacity-api-reporting-pipeline

In this exercise, you'll use portions of each of the skills you've learned in this lesson.

First, you'll configure a new API. This API will have a new app configuration file that you can call appfinal.py.

Second, you'll write a new endpoint for the API. This new endpoint will read a pickle file for a deployed model, and it will also read a dataset. It will use the deployed pickle file to make predictions for the dataset, and it will return the prediction it makes.

Third, you'll write a script call apicall.py that will call this API. You can use either method for calling API's that we learned in this lesson - the choice is yours.
